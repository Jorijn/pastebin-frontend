        Hello! I am Jorijn Schrijvershof, a 27-year old web developer from Helmond, The Netherlands.

      <p>
        During my journey on learning React, I wanted to create a real life application to try
        some popular technologies. The idea was born, my goal would to be to create worlds most
        overkill application to host code snippets. Although the application itself does not
        contain many features, you are looking at:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is a Progressive Web App.
          You <em>could</em> use it offline. But generally,
          it's just very fast.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's created using <code>create-react-app</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          It uses <code>redux</code> for global state tracking
          and <code>redux-saga</code> for asynchronous updating
          and API communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          I try to follow Webpack conventions and import my CSS and images.
        </li>
      </ul>
